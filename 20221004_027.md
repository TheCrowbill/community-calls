## Code is Law vs World Computer

Shout out to bob's discord.

> Code is Law versus World Computer.  
> Both are useful, but they are different.  
> Ethereum started out trying to build both within a single project, but they were mutually irreconcilable.  
> Both were promised from the very start.  
> Some people jumped aboard the Ethereum train based on one vision, and some for the other.  
> Do you want programmable Bitcoin (ETC) or do you want world computer / decentralized application platform (ETH)?  
> That also explains the very different reactions to the DAO hack.  
> If you think Ethereum is hard money then of course you don't want to intervene.  
> If you think Ethereum is a computing platform, and that ETH is "fuel", not money, then you see a "bug" and want to fix it if you can, even if it's an ugly hack.  
> Any software developers out there will know that lots of software has lots of warts and horrible hacks, where "layering" is not clean at all, and you can end up with hacks and workarounds in the "wrong places" if that results in the rectification of problems which should never have happened in the first place, but did, and you need/want to patch them up.  
> I think that is very much the mindset which led to the DAO hard fork.  
> There is a hacker.   He is stealing our money.   We have the opportunity to stop that theft, so lets do that. 
> Fixing a bug.  
> Which makes sense if you see Ethereum as mainly a computing platform, like the web, like iOS or Android.  
> Not if you see Ethereum as money.  

False narrative? Instead;

> Code is Law is what enables World Computer, because that's the only way the system can remain neutral to every human being

## RAI

(from ronin discord)

Yeah, this looks interesting to me as well. I think topics like RAI (a detailed discussion) on community calls would be good and educational. This convo can go from educational to building a roadmap where there are products being deployed that have community interest. As mentioned- I'm still researching and such. But I think now that we are post-merge, this would be a good direction to start shifting conversation from a professional perspective.

Topics:
+ ECIPs related to L1
+ necessary L1 products
+ L2 planning
