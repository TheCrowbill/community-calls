### Progress

#### Mastodon Idea

```
thinking about incentives for participation and the POAP stuff. We are thinking about NFTs, but what about a real life account that will populate all over mastodon.

Potential reward for contributors: @username@ethereumclassic.network mastodon username accounts that you can bridge to any of your twitter accounts via:
https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/

My understanding is setting up the server would be about $6/mo on costs for the service. Could be a good use for this domain if it incentivizes contributions. Chat about it, let me know if there is an appetite for it.
your account would show up like this:

but would read: @ronin@ethereumclassic.network on all of mastodon servers.
and the proof of contributions would be a way to earn these names. opposed to something like an ENS where you pay for the name.
This would also allows us to have a historical record of accounts via the twitter linking, so if the users account is banned on twitter, they can relink their new twitter account to their vanity ethereum classic mastodon and keep posting (thinking of Donald here with his frequent twitter names). So @DonaldMcIntyre@ethereumclassic.network would maintain a feed of all his posts despite changing twitter names due to their ToS or whater, as an example. 
Also perhaps we could brand/theme up the mastodon instance and give it an ETC feel for users.
