### From Coop Discord

The DFG times ran from Dec 2018 to Dec 2021.

DFG is Digital Finance Group, which is James Wo's company who created ETC Labs and were involved in the ETC ecosystem over that timespan, though the last year they were very inactive, only funding the Core Geth team, with no other people and no media presence (dead twitter, dead website).

They made numerous missteps, especially in their communication channels and especially in their Chinese language communication and "community" efforts.

- They stole the ethereumproject org in Github (one of them added as a admin and then he removed all the others and took over)
- They promised funding to ETCDEV and then pulled it at the last minute, leading to the death of ETCDEV
- And then rehired all the devs as ETC Labs Core, indeed everyone there except Igor and Donald  (both of whom would not comply to their wishes)
- They forked the ECIP process into ETC Labs Improvement Process, stating that they didn't care what "ethereumclassic" (ie the existing community) wanted and would set direction as they saw best and people could follow or not.
- They announced a hard fork to the Chinese community which had not gone through the ECIP process and was not consensus.
- They crapped all over Roy Zhou's existing ETC community and "made a new one", calling that "Official".
- They donated 250K to ETC Coop (before my time) and James Wo became a board member.
- Their "community guy" Christian Xu, who was paid by DFG, was declared to be the part of the ETC Coop (but he did not report to me and I was not giving him any direction).
- They used that ETC Cooperative connection as validation for their work.
- They had DFG-funded social media outlets, and especially Chinese-language outlets where they presented themselves as the voice and guardian of the protocol.   Controlling developers and media outlets and pushing self-serving messages.
- Example - pointing to their wallet as the "official ETC wallet", etc
.
Because of this history, many in the ETC community in the West are very wary of similar "mixed messages" happening in channels which they don't understand the language for, and especially in China, given the size of the country, number of people involved, size of ETC community there.   And, indeed, in Asia as a whole. 
.
I think the very best way of ensuring everyone is on the same page is Chinese translations for:

- ETC community website
- Mailing list for ETC Cooperative
- Twitter account? (maybe we can set up a parallel twitter together which tweets translations of all the eth_classic tweets?

We obviously cannot combine or translate Discord or other "chat forums", because the content is constant and coming from multiple people.   Translation tools might make this somewhat accessible, but really people need to speak English and Chinese to really be part of both communities.
.
With regards to the WeChat and Telegram channels managed by @南离777, I think we just need to ensure there is a clean separation between those lists and Hebe.    I know that is the case.   @南离777 has made that very clear with repeated explanations about his own and @zhang's history.   That @南离777 does not work for Hebe and so on.
